<h2>Power Shot 💥</h2>
        <p>The Power Shot is pure aggression—a strike hit with maximum force. It aims to overpower the goalkeeper with speed, often requiring a wind-up and a clean connection through the center of the ball.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Locking the Ankle:** Keeping the striking foot rigid for power transfer.</li>
            <li>**Follow-Through:** Driving the knee and leg through the ball's path.</li>
            <li>**Contact:** Hitting the middle of the ball with the laces for a straight, hard trajectory.</li>
        </ul>

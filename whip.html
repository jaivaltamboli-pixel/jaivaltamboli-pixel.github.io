<h2>Whip Cross 🌪️</h2>
        <p>The Whip Cross is a fast, curling cross delivered with pace, often from deep or wide positions. The curve makes it difficult for defenders to clear, bending into the space between the defender and the goal.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Outside Foot:** Using the outside of the foot for a strong, curling trajectory.</li>
            <li>**Pace over Loft:** The ball must travel fast and low/medium height.</li>
            <li>**Aim:** Targeting the area just behind the center back's head for a striker's run.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>**Patient Passing:** Short, quick passes to maintain rhythm.</li>
            <li>**Triangles:** Players constantly create passing triangles to ensure options.</li>
            <li>**Counter-Pressing:** Winning the ball back immediately after it's lost.</li>
        </ul>
